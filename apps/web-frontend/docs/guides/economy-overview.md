Economy in Miners Online is implemented with two plugins, The New Economy and Quick Shop Hikari, which together provide a robust and flexible economic system for players to engage with.

## Currency

The New Economy supports multiple currencies, however Miners Online currently uses a single currency called "Dollars".

Currency has a limited use but there are key features that make it an important part of the game:
- **Player Shops**: Players can set up their own shops using Quick Shop Hikari, allowing them to buy and sell items to other players using Dollars.
- **Region Upkeep**: Players need to pay a regular fee in Dollars to maintain ownership of their claimed land, encouraging active participation in the economy.
- **Region Membership Taxes**: Players who are members of regions are required to pay taxes in Dollars to the region owner, providing a source of income for region owners and adding a layer of economic interaction between players.
- **Region Lease Payments**: Players can lease land from region owners for a fee in Dollars, allowing them to use the land for their own purposes without owning it outright.

Players have a starting balance of $200 Dollars when they first join the server and can earn more through the already mentioned features.

## Player Shops

Quick Shop Hikari allows players to create their own shops where they can buy and sell items to other players using Dollars. Players can set their own prices and manage their inventory, creating a dynamic player-driven economy.

Making a shop is a relatively simple process:
> 1. Place a chest where you want your shop to be.
> 2. Hold the item you want to sell or buy in your hand, with the exact amount you want to trade.
> 3. Left-click (*or your attack button*) the chest to create the shop.
> 4. Type the price you want to set for the item in chat.

After completing these steps, a holographic item will appear above the chest and a sign will be placed on the chest displaying the shop information.
