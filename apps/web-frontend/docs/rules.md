## Land & Property Rules

Most land management is handled automatically through the [Homestead plugin](https://tayebyassine.github.io/Homestead/). Please refer to its documentation for detailed usage instructions. The following additional rules apply:

1. **No Griefing**  
    Deliberately destroying or sabotaging other players’ work for malicious reasons is not allowed.
2. **No Panhandle Regions**
    Each area of interest (base, farm, shop, etc.) must be protected in its own region, do not create a region with an excessively large panhandle to cover multiple areas. See the [Land Claiming Guide](../guides/land-claiming) for more information. **Another benefit, you won't hit region size limits as quickly.**<details>
